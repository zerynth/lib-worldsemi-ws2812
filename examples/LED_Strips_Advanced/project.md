LED Strips Advanced
===================

An advanced example showing some awesome features of Zerynth and the ledstrip module to drive WS2812 RGB Led strip â€” or NeoPixel in Adafruit parlance.

A complex animation (a pulsating background and two "snakes" moving in opposing
directions) is performed with indipendent layers animated by threads. Before any ledstrip
update (the on() function) the layers are merged together to obtain the correct animation frame.

To avoid conflicts between threads, a lock is needed during layer modification phase.
