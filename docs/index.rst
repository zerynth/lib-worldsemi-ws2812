Worldsemi WS2812 RGB LEDs
*************************

The Worldsemi WS2812 Integrated Light Source — or NeoPixel in Adafruit parlance — is the latest advance in the quest for a simple, scalable and affordable full-color LED. RGB LEDs are integrated alongside a driver chip into a tiny surface-mount package piloted through a single-wire control protocol.

They can be used individually, chained into longer strings or assembled into still more interesting form-factors; some product example can be found at `Adafruit dedicated page <https://www.adafruit.com/categories/168>`_.
